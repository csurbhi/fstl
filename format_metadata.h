/*
 * Design:
 * SB1, SB2, Revmap, Translation Map, Revmap Bitmap, CKPT, SIT, Dataa
 *
 * We dont want to keep two revmap entries:
 * 1. We can at max loose 1 sector of entries + 1 page of in memory entries. 
 * We are okay with that? This will happen, in spite of keeping two entries. 
 * It will happen inspite of keeping a journal.
 *
 * The translation entries:
 * 1. We donâ€™t have to keep two copies. Because we have the entries in revmap. 
 *    So we already do have two copies.
 * 2. If we crash, then we can copy the contents of the revmap back to the 
 *    translation table.
 *
 *
 * Revmap bitmap: Only 1 copy
 * 1. We keep only one copy. On a crash, when we reboot, we just ignore this 
 *    revmap bit map.
 * 2. We read the revmap entries and write them out to the translation map.
 * 3. Then we start with a new bitmap.
 *
 *  SIT:
 * 1. We keep only one copy.
 * 2. If one sector gets destroyed while writing, then we do the following:
 *       i) We create the RB tree by reading the translation map.
 *       ii) While doing so, we keep a count of the valid blocks in every 
 *	    sector and then rebuild the SIT.
 *       iii) This way, we can ignore what is on disk.
 *       iv) We use the mtime that is stored in the last ckpt for entries where
 *	    the valid blocks dont match with our calculation.
 *
 *
 * Checkpoint:
 *        We keep two copies of this. We need the mtime for further SIT
 *        calculation. Also this is just one sector of information. We keep one
 *        checkpoint in one block. We write alternately to the checkpoints. The
 *        checkpoint with the higher elapsed time is the right checkpoint.
 * 
 *
 * So our order of writing is as follows:
 * 1. Write the data
 * 2. Write revmap entries.
 * 3. Data is now secured on the disk
 * 4. Write trans map entries
 * 5. Write revmap bitmap
 * 6. Write checkpoint
 * 7. Write SIT
 * 
 * do_ckpt() Performs 5, 6, 7 in order. We wait for 5, 6, and 7 to complete before proceeding by putting a barrier after 7.
 *
 * Revmap bitmap can be updated only after the translation blocks have been
 * written on disk.
 * SIT can only be updated after revmap entries are on disk.
 * Checkpoint variables can be updated only after revmap entries are on disk.
 *
 * So, we need some mechanism to identify that there was a crash.
 * We can keep this information in the checkpoint.
 * ckpt->clean can be 0 in ctr() and 1 in dtr().
 * On the next mount if ckpt->clean is 0, then we know we had a crash!
