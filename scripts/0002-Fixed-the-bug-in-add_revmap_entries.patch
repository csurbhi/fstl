Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Fixed the bug in add_revmap_entries.

Unassigned pointer was being referenced causing a NULL pointer
exception.

Next bug:
While copying multiple files on ext2, filesystem gets corrupted.
This implies some write error! Most likely a translation map
error. Check the translation map (write frontier), check partial writes,
check writes when it cannot be accomodated in the current write
frontier.
Write a user space program to deal with all of these cases.
Read the file later.
mount, write the above files, unmount, mount, read the above files and
verify the contents are the same, unmount.
